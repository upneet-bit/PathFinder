# Path Finding Visualizer

This is a Path Finding Visualizer project built using React. It allows you to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action, helping you understand how these algorithms work and compare their performance.
## Features
- Interactive grid: You can create walls by clicking and dragging on the grid, which represent obstacles for the pathfinding algorithms. You can created weighted cells by adding weights on the grid.
- Start and target nodes: You can set the start and target nodes by clicking on the respective cells. The algorithms will find the shortest path between these two nodes.
- Multiple algorithms: The visualizer supports pathfinding algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Clear the grid: You can easily clear the grid to start a new visualization.

## Usage

1. Set the start node: Click on a cell in the grid to set it as the start node.

2. Set the target node: Click on another cell in the grid to set it as the target node.

3. Add walls: Click and drag on the cells to create walls, representing obstacles for the pathfinding algorithms. 

4. Add weight: Click and drag on the cells to create weighted cells, representing costly operations for the pathfinding algorithms. 

5. Select an algorithm: Choose one of the available algorithms from the dropdown menu.

6. Start the visualization: Click the "Run" button to start the visualization process.

7. Clear the grid: To start a new visualization, click the "Reset" button.
Enjoy visualizing pathfinding algorithms!
